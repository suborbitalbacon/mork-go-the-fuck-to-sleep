## Mork, go the fuck to sleep
A script that when run using Task Scheduler can randomly shutdown your computer. The uncertinty will either make you crazy or force you to stop what you're doing, save your work, and go to bed.

### Useage
Place the `random_shutdown.bat` file anywhere on your computer and using Task Scheduler have it run when you want to start thinking about going to bed. 5 - 30 minutes after the scheduled time you computer will shut down.

This script is only tested on Windows 10, but I see no reason it would not work on Windows 7.
